# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

PeriFlow Client Python SDK provides a handy way to manage resources in PeriFlow system (e.g., checkpoints, deployments) and send requests to the deployment endpoints.

## Examples

This example shows how to create a deployment and send a completion API request to the created deployment with Python SDK.

```python
import periflow as pf


# Set up PeriFlow context.
pf.init(
    api_key="YOUR_PERIFLOW_API_KEY",
    project_name="my-project",
)

# Create a deployment at GCP asia-northest3 region wtih one A100 GPU.
deployment = pf.Deployment.create(
    checkpoint_id="YOUR_CHECKPOINT_ID",
    name="my-deployment",
    gpu_type="a100",
    cloud="gcp",
    region="asia-northeast3",
    ...
)
```

When the deployment becomes the "Healthy" status and ready to process inference requests, you can generate a completion with:

```python
# Generate a completion by sending an inference request to the deployment created above.
api = pf.Completion(deployment_id=deployment.deployment_id)
completion = api.create(
    options=pf.V1CompletionOptions(
        prompt="Python is a popular language for",
        max_tokens=100,
        top_p=0.8,
        temperature=0.5,
        no_repeat_ngram=3,
    )
)
print(completion.choices[0].text)
