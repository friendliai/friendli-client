### Converting Hugging Face Checkpoint (Optional)

If you have a Hugging Face checkpoint and want to convert it to a PeriFlow-compatible format, you need to install the package with the following command:

```sh
pip install periflow-client[mllib]
```

If you don't need to convert the checkpoint, you don't need to install `periflow-client`.
