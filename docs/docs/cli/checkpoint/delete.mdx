# pf checkpoint delete

## Usage

```bash
pf checkpoint delete [OPTIONS] CHECKPOINT_IDS
```

## Summary

Deletes the existing checkpoint.

:::info
Deleting linked checkpoints created with `pf checkpoint create` simply unlinks the
checkpoint from the PeriFlow system. That is, it does not physically delete the
checkpoint objects from the source cloud storage (your cloud storage).

Checkpoints that are uploaded or generated from training jobs are physically deleted.
