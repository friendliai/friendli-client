# pf checkpoint restore

## Usage

```bash
pf checkpoint restore CHECKPOINT_ID
```

## Summary

Restores deleted checkpoint (available within 24 hours from the deletion).

When a checkpoint that is uploaded or generated from the training job is deleted,
it is not physically deleted right away. Instead, it is soft-deleted and can be
restored within 24 hours after the deletion. After the 24-hour retention period, it
is hard-deleted and cannot be restored.

:::caution
When you delete a linked checkpoint, you cannot restore it. Instead, relink the
original checkpoint using `pf checkpoint create`.
